# Bubble Blogs

## Introduction

I got tired of the over-abstraction in Wordpress. It seemed more belaboring finding all the hooks in "The Loop" from that monstrosity of a documentation to create a new theme that it felt easier just to create a blog from scratch. But if I want a WYSISYG page builder for co-authors not to have to mess with the code, then I might as well build one.

## Built With
* [Django](https://docs.djangoproject.com/en/3.1/releases/3.1.1/) "D-J-A-N-G-O. The D is silent."
